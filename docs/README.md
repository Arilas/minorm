Minorm is an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) that aims to stay out of your way and make it as easy as possible to use the full power of SQL and the underlying database engine while still making the common stuff easy and enjoyable.

With Minorm you get all the benefits of an SQL query builder but also a powerful set of tools for working with relations and schema.

Minorm is built on top of SQL query builder called [squel](https://github.com/hiddentao/squel). The main supported database is MariaDB/MySQL using [Node MySQL2](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2) connection pool.
